I'll be using AWS services including AWS Lambda, Amazon S3, and Amazon SQS, as well as Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool like AWS CloudFormation. I'll use Python for writing the Lambda function as it's widely used for such tasks.

Process Overview:

We will create an AWS Lambda function that will be triggered whenever a new file is uploaded to the S3 bucket.
This function will read the CSV files, perform the necessary data transformation, and then send the output to an Amazon SQS queue in JSON format.
AWS Lambda Function:

Here is a simplified version of the AWS Lambda function that will be triggered when a new file is uploaded to the S3 bucket:

```
import json
import boto3
import csv
import os
from datetime import datetime
from collections import defaultdict

s3 = boto3.client('s3')
sqs = boto3.client('sqs')

def lambda_handler(event, context):
    try:
        bucket = event['Records'][0]['s3']['bucket']['name']
        key = event['Records'][0]['s3']['object']['key']

        # Temporary file to store the CSV from S3
        download_path = '/tmp/{}'.format(os.path.basename(key))
        s3.download_file(bucket, key, download_path)

        # Process the CSV file
        if 'customers' in key:
            process_customers(download_path)
        elif 'orders' in key:
            process_orders(download_path)
        elif 'items' in key:
            process_items(download_path)
    except Exception as e:
        # Send error message to SQS
        sqs.send_message(
            QueueUrl='SQS_QUEUE_URL',
            MessageBody=json.dumps({
                "type": "error_message",
                "message": str(e)
            })
        )

def process_customers(path):
    # Assuming 'id' is unique per customer
    customers = {}
    with open(path, 'r') as file:
        reader = csv.DictReader(file)
        for row in reader:
            customers[row['customer_reference']] = {
                'first_name': row['first_name'],
                'last_name': row['last_name'],
                'status': row['status']
            }
    return customers

def process_orders(path):
    # Assuming 'id' is unique per order
    orders = {}
    with open(path, 'r') as file:
        reader = csv.DictReader(file)
        for row in reader:
            orders[row['order_reference']] = {
                'customer_reference': row['customer_reference'],
                'order_status': row['order_status'],
                'order_timestamp': datetime.utcfromtimestamp(int(row['order_timestamp'])).strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')
            }
    return orders

def process_items(path):
    items = defaultdict(list)
    with open(path, 'r') as file:
        reader = csv.DictReader(file)
        for row in reader:
            items[row['order_reference']].append({
                'item_name': row['item_name'],
                'quantity': row['quantity'],
                'total_price': row['total_price']
            })
    return items

def aggregate_data(customers, orders, items):
    messages = []
    for customer_ref, customer_data in customers.items():
        message = {
            "type": "customer_message",
            "customer_reference": customer_ref,
            "number_of_orders": 0,
            "total_amount_spent": 0
        }
        
        for order_ref, order_data in orders.items():
            if order_data['customer_reference'] == customer_ref:
                message["number_of_orders"]
                message["number_of_orders"] += 1
                for item in items[order_ref]:
                    message["total_amount_spent"] += float(item['total_price'])
        messages.append(message)

    # Send messages to SQS
    for message in messages:
        sqs.send_message(
            QueueUrl='SQS_QUEUE_URL',
            MessageBody=json.dumps(message)
        )
 ```
  
  
  
  
#Infrastructure as Code (IaC) using AWS CloudFormation:

We can use AWS CloudFormation to create and manage the necessary AWS resources for this task. Here's an example of a CloudFormation template for creating an S3 bucket, a Lambda function, and an SQS queue:

```
Resources:
  MyBucket:
    Type: "AWS::S3::Bucket"
    Properties:
      BucketName: "my-bucket"

  MySQSQueue:
    Type: "AWS::SQS::Queue"
    Properties:
      QueueName: "my-sqs-queue"

  MyLambdaFunction:
    Type: "AWS::Lambda::Function"
    Properties:
      FunctionName: "MyLambdaFunction"
      Runtime: "python3.8"
      Handler: "index.handler"
      Role: "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/my-lambda-role"
      Code:
        S3Bucket: "my-bucket"
        S3Key: "lambda_function.zip"

  LambdaInvokePermission:
    Type: "AWS::Lambda::Permission"
    Properties:
      Action: "lambda:InvokeFunction"
      FunctionName: !GetAtt MyLambdaFunction.Arn
      Principal: "s3.amazonaws.com"
      SourceAccount: !Sub "${AWS::AccountId}"
      SourceArn: !GetAtt MyBucket.Arn

  BucketNotification:
    Type: "AWS::S3::BucketNotificationConfiguration"
    Properties:
      Bucket: !Ref MyBucket
      NotificationConfiguration:
        LambdaConfigurations:
          - Event: "s3:ObjectCreated:*"
            Function: !GetAtt MyLambdaFunction.Arn
```



This CloudFormation template creates an S3 bucket, an SQS queue, and a Lambda function. The Lambda function is configured to be triggered when a new file is uploaded to the S3 bucket.

Scalability:

The serverless architecture is inherently scalable. AWS Lambda will automatically scale to process the number of incoming S3 events concurrently. AWS SQS can handle unlimited volume of transactions per second, so it can handle a very high throughput.

For data storage, the processed data can be stored in a database such as Amazon DynamoDB. DynamoDB is a NoSQL database service that provides fast and predictable performance with seamless scalability.

Improvements:

Error Handling: In the current setup, we are simply sending an error message to the SQS queue. This could be improved by adding more sophisticated error handling and retry mechanisms.
Monitoring: We could use Amazon CloudWatch to monitor our AWS resources, collect and track metrics, collect and monitor log files, and respond to system-wide performance changes.
Data Validation: Before processing the CSV files, we can validate the data to ensure it meets our application's requirements.
Security: We could use AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) to manage access to our AWS resources. We can create and manage AWS users and groups, and use permissions to allow and deny their access to AWS resources.

Testing and Debugging:

We should have a testing and debugging strategy in place. AWS provides services such as AWS X-Ray which can help in debugging and analysis of our microservices.

Data Backup:

It's crucial to have a data backup and recovery strategy in place. For data stored in DynamoDB, we can enable point-in-time recovery which protects our tables from accidental write or delete operations.

CI/CD Pipeline:

We can set up a CI/CD pipeline for our serverless application using AWS CodePipeline and AWS CodeBuild. This allows we can to automate the build, test, and deploy phases of our release process every time there is a code change.

Documentation:

Document our setup, services used, codebase, and the infrastructure setup. This helps in maintaining the code in the long run and makes onboarding new developers easier. AWS provides a service called AWS Artifact for this purpose.

Here is a simplified directory structure of our project:

```
/my_project
|-- /lambda_function
|   |-- index.py
|   |-- requirements.txt
|-- /cloudformation
|   |-- infrastructure.yaml
|-- README.md
```


lambda_function/index.py: This is where the code for the AWS Lambda function is stored.

lambda_function/requirements.txt: This file includes any Python dependencies our Lambda function might need.

cloudformation/infrastructure.yaml: This is the CloudFormation template file that defines our AWS infrastructure.

README.md: This is the documentation for our project.

In the README.md, we should include the following sections:

Introduction: Brief description of the project.

Architecture: High-level overview of the architecture, including a diagram would be helpful.

Setup: Detailed instructions on how to set up the project.

Usage: Instructions on how to use the system, any important endpoints, and any user interfaces.

Deployment: Detailed instructions on how to deploy the project.

Testing: Any instructions on how to run tests, and any testing strategies used.

Debugging: How to debug the project if necessary.

Improvements: Any improvements that could be made to the system.

Conclusion: Final thoughts and conclusions about the project.

Finally, the serverless architecture leverages fully managed services, it will scale automatically to meet the needs of our application, we don't need to provision or manage servers, and we only pay for what we use, making it a cost-effective choice.
